//! `FarmHash`, a family of hash functions.
//!
//! by Geoff Pike
//!
//! https://github.com/google/farmhash
//!
//! Introduction
//! ============
//!
//! `FarmHash` provides hash functions for strings and other data.  The functions
//! mix the input bits thoroughly but are not suitable for cryptography.  See
//! "Hash Quality," below, for details on how `FarmHash` was tested and so on.
//!
//! We provide reference implementations in C++, with a friendly MIT license.
//!
//! All members of the `FarmHash` family were designed with heavy reliance on
//! previous work by Jyrki Alakuijala, Austin Appleby, Bob Jenkins, and others.
//!
//!
//! Recommended Usage
//! =================
//!
//! Our belief is that the typical hash function is mostly used for in-memory hash
//! tables and similar.  That use case allows hash functions that differ on
//! different platforms, and that change from time to time.  For this, I recommend
//! using wrapper functions in a .h file with comments such as, "may change from
//! time to time, may differ on different platforms, and may change depending on
//! NDEBUG."
//!
//! Some projects may also require a forever-fixed, portable hash function.  Again
//! we recommend using wrapper functions in a .h, but in this case the comments on
//! them would be very different.
//!
//! We have provided a sample of these wrapper functions in src/farmhash.h.  Our
//! hope is that most people will need nothing more than src/farmhash.h and
//! src/farmhash.cc.  Those two files are a usable and relatively portable library.
//! (One portability snag: if your compiler doesn't have `__builtin_expect` then
//! you may need to define `FARMHASH_NO_BUILTIN_EXPECT`.)  For those that prefer
//! using a configure script (perhaps because they want to "make install" later),
//! `FarmHash` has one, but for many people it's best to ignore it.
//!
//! Note that the wrapper functions such as Hash() in src/farmhash.h can select
//! one of several hash functions.  The selection is done at compile time, based
//! on your machine architecture (e.g., `sizeof(size_t)`) and the availability of
//! vector instructions (e.g., SSE4.1).
//!
//! To get the best performance from `FarmHash`, one will need to think a bit about
//! when to use compiler flags that allow vector instructions and such: -maes,
//! -msse4.2, -mavx, etc., or their equivalents for other compilers.  Those are
//! the g++ flags that make g++ emit more types of machine instructions than it
//! otherwise would.  For example, if you are confident that you will only be
//! using `FarmHash` on systems with SSE4.2 and/or AES, you may communicate that to
//! the compiler as explained in src/farmhash.cc.  If not, use -maes, -mavx, etc.,
//! when you can, and the appropriate choices will be made by via conditional
//! compilation in src/farmhash.cc.
//!
//! It may be beneficial to try -O3 or other compiler flags as well.  I also have
//! found feedback-directed optimization (FDO) to improve the speed of `FarmHash`.
//!
//! Further Details
//! ===============
//!
//! The above instructions will produce a single source-level library that
//! includes multiple hash functions.  It will use conditional compilation, and
//! perhaps GCC's multiversioning, to select among the functions.  In addition,
//! "make all check" will create an object file using your chosen compiler, and
//! test it.  The object file won't necessarily contain all the code that would be
//! used if you were to compile the code on other platforms.  The downside of this
//! is obvious: the paths not tested may not actually work if and when you try
//! them.  The `FarmHash` developers try hard to prevent such problems; please let
//! us know if you find bugs.
//!
//! To aid your cross-platform testing, for each relevant platform you may
//! compile your program that uses farmhash.cc with the preprocessor flag
//! FARMHASHSELFTEST equal to 1.  This causes a `FarmHash` self test to run
//! at program startup; the self test writes output to stdout and then
//! calls `std::exit()`.  You can see this in action by running "make check":
//! see src/farm-test.cc for details.
//!
//! There's also a trivial workaround to force particular functions to be used:
//! modify the wrapper functions in hash.h.  You can prevent choices being made via
//! conditional compilation or multiversioning by choosing `FarmHash` variants with
//! names like `farmhashaa::Hash32`, `farmhashab::Hash64`, etc.: those compute the same
//! hash function regardless of conditional compilation, multiversioning, or
//! endianness.  Consult their comments and ifdefs to learn their requirements: for
//! example, they are not all guaranteed to work on all platforms.
//!
//! Known Issues
//! ============
//!
//! 1) `FarmHash` was developed with little-endian architectures in mind.  It should
//! work on big-endian too, but less work has gone into optimizing for those
//! platforms.  To make `FarmHash` work properly on big-endian platforms you may
//! need to modify the wrapper .h file and/or your compiler flags to arrange for
//! `FARMHASH_BIG_ENDIAN` to be defined, though there is logic that tries to figure
//! it out automatically.
//!
//! 2) `FarmHash`'s implementation is fairly complex.
//!
//! 3) The techniques described in dev/INSTRUCTIONS to let hash function
//! developers regenerate src/*.cc from dev/* are hacky and not so portable.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};
//!
//! use fasthash::{farm, FarmHasher};
//!
//! fn hash<T: Hash>(t: &T) -> u64 {
//!     let mut s: FarmHasher = Default::default();
//!     t.hash(&mut s);
//!     s.finish()
//! }
//!
//! let h = farm::hash64(b"hello world\xff");
//!
//! assert_eq!(h, hash(&"hello world"));
//! ```
